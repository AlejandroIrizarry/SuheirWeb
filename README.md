## Suheir's Consultancy & Portfolio Web Site (2021 Web Intro Project)
1. Purpose: This was a website that served as Suheir's personal portfolio to share her profile, her architeture projects and to offer her interior design services. This project was developed for my Web Application Programming college course which served as an introduction to web development.
2. Tools: I used HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, SQL and PHP to build this site. Used to be deployed using FileZilla as the FTP application and a web server provided by Apache and Digital Ocean.
3. Author: Alejandro Irizarry Negrón phone: (939)-226-9444 // e-mail: alejandroirizarry@programmer.net

** Note: Since this was one of my first web development projects as a CS Undergraduate, the site lacks some tools such as media queries and other features or technologies that might make the website better. Nevertheless, it was a fun learning experience.

I will be building this site again in the future.
